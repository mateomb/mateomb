Hi! I'm Mateo Matijević Bošnjak, a senior student at Rochester Institute of Technology.

I'm primarily interested in developing my career, to do this I'm trying to cover as many different fields within my profession. In order to do this I'm often seeking 
new programing languages I can try out, create games in my free time as well as create minor applications and web pages with Java & React.

I'm currently advancing my knowledge of Fullstack Web Development by creating small Web App's via React, HTML, JS, CSS, Express, PostgreSQL, MySQL, PHP.
Alongside this I'm getting into Game Development, and have worked previously with small engines such as Godot. I'm trying to future develop my 
skills and have taken up learning Unreal Engine 5 in my free time.

The best means of reaching me would be via my personal email: mateo.matijevic.bosnjak@gmail.com
